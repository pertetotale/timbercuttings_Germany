"# Streamlit app: Timbercuttings in Germany" 

In this case we concentrate on the timbercuttings due to various kinds of damage: wind, insects, snow, drought...
Grouped by:
- Tree type or tree group
- Federal state
- Kind of damage
- Year

In the last years the proportion of insect damage has increased exponentially. The forced cuttings have left merely bare soil where formerly wooded area was.
These bare soils result in higher rainwater runoff potentials, esp. on grounds with steeper slopes. 
An example is the catastrophic flood in the Ahr basin of 14-15 July 2021. 
There lots of spruces trees were forced to be cut due to insects, with a big increase in timbercuttings starting in 2017.
